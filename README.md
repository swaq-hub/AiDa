# AiDa
AiDa an open source intelligent chatbot

# Phase [1] Completed... 
We now have an endpoint for web users and developers... 

# TODO
- Make Chatbot Conversation.

# How to use AiDa API

1. Get your data ready in Json format. The require key needed is object and message. "object" takes the value "web" for a website or web platform... "message" takes the any string value.
# Example of the data 
{"object":"web", "message":message}
2. Send a request to this url https://maya-2019.herokuapp.com/ along with your json
3. Recieve response in json format.
Response should look like this
{"response":response, "user":"AiDa"}

# P.S: Currently we have put an hold to Social Media Intergrations until futhre notice.

We are working to make it better......
